# 🔢 Number Guesser Game (Python)

A simple and fun command-line game where the player tries to guess a randomly generated number within a limited number of attempts. Great for beginners to practice Python basics like loops, conditionals, and user input.

## 🎮 How to Play

- The computer randomly selects a number within a set range (e.g., 1 to 100).
- You have to guess the number by entering your guesses.
- After each guess, you get feedback:
  - “Too high”
  - “Too low”
  - Or “Correct!”
- The game ends when you guess the number or run out of attempts.
